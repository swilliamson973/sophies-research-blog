In my first paper prototype i had the idea of creating meal plans for a full week, along with a shopping list where it would give you all the ingredients you needed, I wanted to include a shopping list in my website as my idea was to reduce food wastage, along with a weeks worth of meal plans which would include foods for meals which would all be used up and not wasted, as it can be a pain buying a bag of potatoes and only using some of them for one meal and the rest going to waste.

My meal plans would include meals that use similar ingredients so nothing would go to waste, compared to other websites i have researched i think it would be a good idea to have a shopping list people can take to the store and buy there own personal preference or brand of sauces etc, this also means people are able to buy stuff that is on special  at there local supermarket, This means that the user is in-charge of there money and purchases rather than being sent ingredients etc

In my First idea i had two ideas of having pages dedicated to tips and tricks and environment, as i wanted to offer informative information bout the growing problem.

for my website shopping list i wanted it to be easy to use while grocery shopping, this is why i had the idea of being able to 1. copy and paste the list where you can paste it into an online supermarket such as countdown, and search item per item, you could also use the list straight of your phone as my site would be mobile adjustable

My Final Site Currently does not include a shopping list, however i think it would of been a good idea to include, In my Products page i have a range of recipes which all list the ingredients needed. 



One of the issues i found after coming up with the idea of a shopping list is that a lot of the recipes use ingredients such as spices like oregano, ground chilli, etc where these items wont need to be brought often, as most households already carry these staple items in there homes. This is why it would make it tricky to create a shopping list as lots of ingredients would not be needed weekly.



**Some ideas to fix this issue include**



1. Having the shopping list only include vegetables and meats as that is needed to be brought straight from the supermarket or frozen.



2. The list is just a guide, and cant be downloaded as there wouldn't be any point in downloading it if you didn't need to buy all the ingredients



3. a button on the recipes where you can add ingredients to the shopping list for all the recipes you are wanting to make, then you can also fill out the blank meal planner with the recipes you have chosen, This also means that any double ups will not be added as two different items

4. if the list included all the ingredients that were needed, expect it is now customisable where you can take away ingredients and possibly add them.

**The Pros of Solution 3. and 4.**

1. it would work well for the user and they would be able to use the shopping list with only the needed ingredients which they themselves have catered to there needs

2. to be able to add ingredients to the shopping list from the recipes  they have chosen to create their own personalised meal plans.

**The Problems with Solution 3. and 4.**

1. being able to code this using bootstrap, as it does not have the functionality to be able to make an adjustable list for the user.



2.  how would this work on a desktop view, as you would still want it to be downloadable or be a specific phone feature as you want to be able to take the list with you to the supermarket.
