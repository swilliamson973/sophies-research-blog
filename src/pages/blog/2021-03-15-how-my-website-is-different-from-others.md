#### The Problem With Sites Like Hello Fresh And How My Site Works Differently.

Hello Fresh is an account based website where you pay for a meal plan and are also sent the ingredients for the week which are used in all your meals throughout the week

This is a screenshot taken from hello fresh's website which is bright and colourful and straight away gets to the point with the 'view our meal plans' button. 



My Website is going to be different from this as i have decided to make it a free service meaning there is no subscribe button or need to make an account unless you want to comment on certain plans, It will be made up of meals plan which are made by me, but in my contact us button there will be an opportunity to send in any ideas of meals you would like to see, I want my website to feel a bit more like a blog with new recipes and  blog posts being uploaded frequently. This will also be good as it means the website can be easily updated with new ideas as well as tips and tricks and environmental blog posts etc.

The Problem i have with Hello Fresh is that you cant physically view any meals or plans before you pay. Personally for me it does not give me enough information to even want to subscribe. Both my website and hello fresh's website have similarities we both have the same 'meal plan' idea but each executed in a different way with different purposes. Hello fresh not only gives you meal plans but they also send the produce right to your door, while this is a good idea i have found from even just ordering from a supermarket online that you can end up with vegetables which are already past there use by date and because of that i now prefer to physically go in store and select my own produce

The website does state all the environmental factors that are beneficial when you meal plan. as-well as my website which aims to do all of these things. and as my site is not a subscription based company i am not making any money off of it unlike hello fresh's site which need to make an income to continue there services, so really where is your money going?

The website has more variety and choice as you can browse recipes individually and add them to your plan and customise your box to what suits your lifestyle. But for my website i want it to be able to help people which are indecisive and need that extra help to live a healthy lifestyle and create healthy fast meals.

The website each week requires payments which for some people isn't affordable, as the price per serving is $9 each for two people thats a total of $18 for one meal.



My Site is different in the aspect that it plans for a whole week, not two, four or five days. and not just dinners it plans breakfasts lunches and dinners to give you a variety of food to eat during the week. as well as the fact that its FREE.
