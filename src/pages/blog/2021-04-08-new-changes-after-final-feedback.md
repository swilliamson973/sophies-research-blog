After my presentation i got this feedback about my website

\-Change header colour

\- Add White spacing to let the page breathe

\- header line not really needed





I took out the top and bottom featurette dividers, as well as adding more padding on top and below the photos and headers to all the pages

In the About page i added a "call to action button"

Home Page Below - Here i changed the background photo of the feature image and i also added background colour to the title to make it easier to read, as well as making the line weight of the sub heading thicker.
