Cole- Website is easy to use and navigate, Thinks more meal plans would be a good idea and have more dietary requirements/ more plans for each requirement, More inclusive. 

From here i would take my site further by offering more meal plans for each diet requirement, as well as cater to more dietary requirements like gluten or dairy free etc, i would also add alternatives in my recipes for people who might be vegetarian etc



Rebekah- Likes the website layout and css styling, Thinks its appealing and makes her motivated to try new recipes of the site, Downloading plans ad a pdf is good because it means she can download and start her own folder of filled out plans with the pre made ones or fill them out herself thinks if there was more products a filter would be needed.

I would add a filter when i create more products, at this point in time it doesn't seem like a necessity, but it is a good idea i would incorporate if i was going to build my website further

Amy- Likes site, Thinks recipes should be more broad and have alternatives for meats etc as, other than that finds website easy and informative. Like blog page and posts as it had lots of informative information. In some places think it needs a "call to action button" (about page) as after reading has to use nav bar

I added a call to action button to the bottom of my About page

My User journeys have all had the same navigation with different purposes for seeking out meal plans,  I think my feedback i got was very useful as for some of it if i was to expand my website i would definitely take the feedback on board.
