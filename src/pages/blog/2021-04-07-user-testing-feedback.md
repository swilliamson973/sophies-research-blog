Cole- Website is easy to use and navigate, Thinks more meal plans would be a good idea and have more dietary requirements/ more plans for each requirement, More inclusive. 



Rebekah- Likes the website layout and css styling, Thinks its appealing and makes her motivated to try new recipes of the site, Downloading plans ad a pdf is good because it means she can download and start her own folder, thinks if there was more products a filter would be needed.



Amy- Likes site, Thinks recipes should be more broad and have alternatives for meats etc as, other than that finds website easy and informative to use but in some places think it needs a "call to action button" (about page) as after reading has to use nav bar





My User journeys have all had the same navigation with different purposes for seeking out meal plans,  I think my feedback i got was very useful as for some of it if i was to expand my website i would definitely take the feedback on board.
