**Mu users all have the same user journey but with different purposes which is explained below** 

**Cole**


Cole works long hours 5 sometimes 6 days a week, after coming home from a long day of work the last thing he wants to do is cook dinner. Cole can be unorganised and ends up needing just a few things from the supermarket a couple times a week, which is a hassle for him.

I think My website would be useful to this user as it will give the user one shop of the week which will give them all the food that is necessary, and no more, which means that it will reduce food waste which is good for the environment, as well as good for the users bank.

**Rebekah**


Rebekah has just made the decision to stop eating meat and become vegetarian, except she is struggling to make food and think of recipe ideas that suit her. 

I think my website will help her as it will be able to filter out recipes that suit certain dietary requirements. It will also help her get back in the kitchen with a positive attitude and a full stomach.
