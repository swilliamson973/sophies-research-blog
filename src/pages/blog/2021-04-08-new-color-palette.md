When editing my website with my original colour palette i found that it was quite hard to place all the colours in together as some of them didn't work well together, i was also unsure how i would incorporate all the colours.

From here i decided to change my colour palette after getting feedback, when researching for a new colour palette i used adobe colour and browsed palettes of the Themes page in the Flavour category (which represents food)



From this i chose this colour palette where all the colours compliment each other with a navy blue as a contrasting colour.

Once i had my colour palette sorted out i found it much easier to use css to customise the look of my website, i feel like it was the thing holding me back in styling my website, i was able to use the navy blue and one of the lighter oranges as headers which have really stood out in my website, i also found that the colour palette really compliments my images as most of them have the same tones in them.

Lastly i updated my style guide to show the new colour palette, After applying these colours to my website i found that it came together a lot faster than it has been since starting the project, as if i was stuck with what to do next except i was un aware what was holding my site back.
