For my Style Guide i have shown my Colour palette and typography, For my typography i have chosen a black colour as well as a white for the majority of my background, I want the three primary colours as well as the orange and green to be highlight colours, I want to use all 5 colours but have the, split up between small white gaps as i personally think thats how they look best. 



For my Typography i have chosen three different weights of the Karla Font, Karla Light for body text, karla Medium for sub headings and Karla Bold for Titles.
