2 The Goal to Create a socially sustainable website, For this i decided to focus on the food wastage and how this affects  the environment



3 Sophie's meal plans come to life, to create a website where a variety of meal plan templates and recipes are able to be downloaded and printed out if needed, as well as a blog page with informative information about food wastage and handy tips and tricks



4 Researched sites, Recipe sites Looking at layout accessibility, Features\
famous celebrity Recipe sites 

a gap in the market when it comes to free easy to use meal plan and recipe ie sites 

 

5 Hello Fresh research, how my site is different from there’s 



6 Green Earthy mood board- represents food such as vegetables



7 Then added more variety of colours as I felt my green colours didn’t compliment each other well



USER JOURNEY for my user journey they all had similar experiences and oaths but with different purposes and outcomes, as I run the website myself there is only a customer based user where they use the site for different purposes 



8 content inventory, I used this to first organise the idea of my pages to put them into this so it would be easier to bring to life, I found as I went through creating my website my content changed as I found out what I could do with bootstrap and css



9 for my sketching my images show my first ideas, as soon as they come to mind, as I’m often the person who needs to draw whatever they learnt straight away down this is exactly how I did this then writing notes as I went to what could change to make it more accessible



10 my paper prototypes for my user experience, for most of my users I imagine them all having a similar experience with different purposes 



11 prototype video



12 wireframes basic simple layout, before I had images but simplified the layout where I could then add the content into



13 first style guide which has my cooler palette I though I was going to use



14 I tested these for colourblindness and found they worked for all types, but I didn’t like that all the colours were similar in contrasts and didn’t work well together on a website point of view



15 last minute colour palette suits my photos and relates to food



16 typography use karla in light medium bold, with 4 orange and red tone colours and one navy contrasting colour



17 also works for colour-blindness



18 css styling, simple bold buttons and headers, using contrasting colours in titles etc, working around bootstrap and using bootstrap examples to then css the examples 



Technical stuff is hard



19 I used grids to layout my pages and Cloudinary to upload my images, I also created some vector images in illustrator to use as pin points for blog posts 



20 my website also works in phone view and is still assessable and nicely laid out



21 for coding I used classes to organise my css as well as using css variables to make it easy to add and change colours to my css



22 my user feedback was good, I have taken the feedback on board and if I was to take it further I would follow their feedback



23 my performance testing had a highs chore of accessibly, not so much for performance, which is probably because some of my images won’t be sized properly and take a while to load



24 I like my website
